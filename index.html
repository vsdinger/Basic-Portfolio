  <img src="C:\Users\golde\Pictures\angels of haiti.jpg">

  <p>Born and raised in CA all her life. </p>
  <p>Loves sports, what sports she could not play, she learned about and became a referee instead.  Outdoors has always been her Zen spot.  Learned at a young age how to fissh, hunt, hiking, archery, bird watching, swimming, boating, water skiing, diving, and sitting at beach watching people/waves.  God keeps me centered.  My family gives me love.  Job keeps me alive and gives me lots to do.  My Zen is where I am close to God is on my mission's trip. </p> 
  <p>Reading novels is not my style but give me a research paper and I am off running.  Cross checking everything, deciding what stats need revisited and what variables should have been identified.   When my first grandson was born I learned why I was placed in this field.  See my grandson was non-verbal autistic.  I started working with him and gathered all the information I could.  This research helped me to assist giving proper tools to my grandson.  He is now a functioning and in school.  I am proud of all he has learned and can not wait to see what life has for him next.
